# Chess Knight Training
The goal is to reach every blue marked square with the black knight. You begin at h8 (if it is possible) and you have to reach h1(if it is possible). White pieces are able to catch you. The code isn't well commented and is lack of optimization. It doesn't use any engines (e.g. stockfish), everything is solved programmatically.  However this is a completly fun Project, my initial goal was to create a drag and drop functionality for WPF controls and somehow I ended up here... 
I hope to extend the functionality of this project in the future.
